# Task 1: Project Structure & Build System Setup

**Status:** 🟢 Complete  
**Dependencies:** None  

## Description
Set up the foundational Go project structure with proper module organization and build system configuration.

---

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Initialize Go Module Structure 🟢
- Create `go.mod` with appropriate module name
- Set up basic directory structure (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `web/`)
- Configure Go version and initial dependencies

### 1.2 Configure Build System 🟢
- Create `Makefile` for common build tasks
- Set up cross-platform build targets (Linux, Windows)
- Configure build flags and optimization settings
- Create build scripts for development vs production

### 1.3 Set Up Version Management 🟢
- Implement version embedding in build process
- Create versioning strategy (semantic versioning)
- Configure build-time variable injection

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `go mod tidy` runs without errors
- [x] `make build` produces executable for current platform
- [x] Cross-platform builds work for Linux and Windows
- [x] Version information is embedded in binary
- [x] Project structure follows Go best practices
