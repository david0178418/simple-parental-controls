# Task 5: Service Lifecycle Management

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Complete  
**Dependencies:** Task 1.2, Task 3.3  

## Description
Implement basic service lifecycle management including start, stop, restart, and graceful shutdown.

---

## Subtasks

### 5.1 Service Initialization ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement service startup sequence
- âœ… Add configuration loading and validation
- âœ… Initialize database connections
- âœ… Set up signal handling for graceful shutdown

### 5.2 Service Control Mechanisms ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement start/stop/restart commands
- âœ… Add service status checking
- âœ… Create PID file management
- âœ… Implement service health checks

### 5.3 Graceful Shutdown Handling ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- âœ… Add connection cleanup on shutdown
- âœ… Implement timeout-based shutdown
- âœ… Add shutdown logging and status reporting

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Service starts and initializes all components correctly
- [x] Service can be stopped cleanly without data loss
- [x] Graceful shutdown handles all cleanup tasks
- [x] Service status can be queried and reported
- [x] Error conditions during startup/shutdown are handled properly

---

## Implementation Notes

### Decisions Made
- Used context-based cancellation for coordinated shutdown across goroutines
- Implemented state machine with thread-safe transitions (StateStopped -> StateStarting -> StateRunning -> StateStopping -> StateStopped)
- Created comprehensive service configuration with sensible defaults
- Implemented PID file management with directory creation
- Added periodic health checks with configurable intervals
- Used timeout-based graceful shutdown to prevent hanging
- Integrated with existing database and logging infrastructure

### Issues Encountered  
- Need to handle double start/stop gracefully (implemented idempotent operations)
- Required careful coordination between signal handling and service lifecycle
- Database initialization must happen before repositories
- PID file directory creation needed for robustness

### Resources Used
- Go context package for cancellation patterns
- Standard library signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Existing database and logging packages
