# Task 1: Process Monitoring System

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Complete  
**Dependencies:** Milestone 1 Complete  

## Description
Implement cross-platform process monitoring system that can detect, track, and identify running applications for enforcement decisions.

---

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Cross-Platform Process Detection ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement process enumeration for Linux (`/proc` filesystem)
- âœ… Implement process enumeration for Windows (Process API)
- âœ… Create unified interface for process information
- âœ… Add process metadata extraction (path, command line, PID)

### 1.2 Process Identification System ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Develop executable matching algorithms (path-based, hash-based)
- âœ… Implement process hierarchy tracking (parent-child relationships)
- âœ… Create process signature generation and comparison
- âœ… Add support for different executable identification methods

### 1.3 Real-time Process Monitoring ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement process start/stop event detection
- âœ… Create efficient polling mechanisms with configurable intervals
- âœ… Add process state change notifications
- âœ… Implement monitoring thread management and lifecycle

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] System can enumerate all running processes on both platforms
- [x] Process identification works reliably for various executable types
- [x] Real-time monitoring detects process starts/stops within 1 second
- [x] Process monitoring uses <2% CPU under normal load
- [x] System handles process permission restrictions gracefully
