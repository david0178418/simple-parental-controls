# Task 2: Network Filtering Framework

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Dependencies:** Task 1.2  

## Description
Design and implement pluggable network filtering framework that can intercept and control network traffic across different platforms.

---

## Subtasks

### 2.1 Abstract Filtering Interface ðŸ”´
- Design pluggable network filter architecture
- Create common interface for platform-specific implementations
- Define filter rule data structures and formats
- Implement filter chain management system

### 2.2 Traffic Interception Layer ðŸ”´
- Design traffic capture mechanisms for different platforms
- Implement packet/connection inspection interfaces
- Create URL extraction and analysis system
- Add support for various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS)

### 2.3 Filter Decision Engine ðŸ”´
- Implement rule evaluation logic for URLs and domains
- Create wildcard and regex matching systems
- Add caching for performance optimization
- Implement allow/block decision processing

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework supports pluggable platform-specific implementations
- [ ] Traffic interception works for HTTP and HTTPS connections
- [ ] URL matching supports exact, wildcard, and domain patterns
- [ ] Filter decisions are made within 10ms for cached rules
- [ ] Framework handles high-traffic scenarios without blocking
