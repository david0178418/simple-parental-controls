# Task 3: Linux Implementation (iptables)

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Complete  
**Dependencies:** Task 2.1  

## Description
Implement Linux-specific network filtering using iptables integration and system-level process monitoring.

---

## Subtasks

### 3.1 iptables Integration ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement iptables rule generation and management
- âœ… Create dynamic rule insertion/removal system
- âœ… Add support for port-based and IP-based filtering
- âœ… Implement DNS-based domain blocking

### 3.2 Linux Process Integration ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Integrate with Linux process monitoring from Task 1
- âœ… Implement process-to-network connection mapping
- âœ… Add support for application-specific network filtering
- âœ… Create privilege escalation handling for iptables

### 3.3 System Integration and Testing ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Test on major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
- âœ… Implement error handling for missing iptables
- âœ… Add fallback mechanisms for restricted environments
- âœ… Create installation and configuration procedures

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] iptables rules are created and managed dynamically
- [ ] Domain blocking works reliably for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- [ ] Process-specific filtering functions correctly
- [ ] Implementation works on Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora
- [ ] System gracefully handles iptables permission issues
