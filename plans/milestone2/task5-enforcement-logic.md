# Task 5: Real-time Enforcement Logic

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Complete  
**Dependencies:** Task 1.3, Task 3.2, Task 4.2  

## Description
Implement the core real-time enforcement engine that coordinates process monitoring and network filtering to apply rules in real-time.

## Subtasks

### 5.1 Enforcement Engine Core ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Create central enforcement coordinator
- âœ… Implement rule processing and decision-making logic
- âœ… Add event-driven enforcement triggers
- âœ… Create enforcement action execution system

### 5.2 Rule Application System ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Implement real-time rule evaluation against processes and network traffic
- âœ… Create rule conflict resolution mechanisms
- âœ… Add support for temporary rule overrides
- âœ… Implement enforcement logging and audit trail

### 5.3 Performance Optimization ðŸŸ¢
- âœ… Optimize rule lookup and matching algorithms
- âœ… Implement caching for frequently accessed rules
- âœ… Add batching for enforcement actions
- âœ… Create performance monitoring and metrics collection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Enforcement actions are applied within 100ms of rule triggers
- [ ] System handles simultaneous process and network events
- [ ] Rule conflicts are resolved consistently
- [ ] Enforcement engine uses <5% CPU under normal load
- [ ] All enforcement actions are properly logged
