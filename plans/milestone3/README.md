- [x] Quota limits are tracked and enforced
- [x] Rule conflicts are detected and handled appropriately

### List Management
- [x] Whitelist and blacklist creation works
- [x] Application and URL entries can be added/removed
- [x] Lists can be enabled/disabled independently
- [x] List export/import functionality works

### Scheduling & Quotas
- [x] Time windows support days of week and hours
- [x] Daily, weekly, and monthly quotas function
- [x] Quota resets happen automatically at boundaries

## Notes & Decisions Log

**Last Updated:** _December 2024_  
**Next Review Date:** _TBD_  
**Current Status:** _Service layer implementation complete - Ready for API and database integration_

### Implementation Decisions Made

1. **Service Layer Architecture**: Implemented comprehensive service layer with separate services for:
   - `ListManagementService`: Core list CRUD operations and validation
   - `EntryManagementService`: Entry management with pattern validation and bulk operations
   - `TimeWindowService`: Time-based rule scheduling with conflict detection
   - `QuotaService`: Usage tracking and quota enforcement with warning levels
   - `RuleValidationService`: Comprehensive conflict detection and resolution

2. **Validation Strategy**: Multi-layered validation approach:
   - Input validation at service level
   - Business logic validation (duplicates, conflicts)
   - Cross-rule validation for system consistency

3. **Conflict Detection**: Implemented sophisticated conflict detection:
   - Hard conflicts (directly contradictory rules)
   - Warning conflicts (potentially confusing behavior)
   - Severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Auto-resolution capabilities where appropriate

4. **Pattern Matching**: Flexible pattern system supporting:
   - Exact matches for precise control
   - Wildcard patterns for broader coverage
   - Domain patterns for URL-based entries

5. **Interface Design**: Added proper Logger interface for dependency injection and testability

### Completed Implementations

âœ… **List Management Service** (`internal/service/list_management.go`)
- Create, update, delete operations with validation
- List duplication and enable/disable functionality
- Name uniqueness validation and cascading deletes

âœ… **Entry Management Service** (`internal/service/entry_management.go`)
- Entry CRUD for executables and URLs with pattern validation
- Bulk operations: import from text, export, search functionality
- Support for exact, wildcard, and domain pattern types

âœ… **Time Window Service** (`internal/service/time_window_service.go`)
- Day-of-week and hour-based scheduling
- Real-time rule evaluation with conflict detection
- Support for "allow_during" and "block_during" rule types

âœ… **Quota Service** (`internal/service/quota_service.go`)
- Daily, weekly, monthly quota management
- Usage tracking with automatic period resets
- Progressive warning levels (low, medium, high)

âœ… **Rule Validation Service** (`internal/service/rule_validation_service.go`)
- System-wide conflict detection
- Severity-based conflict classification
- Cross-rule validation and consistency checks

### Next Steps Required

1. **API Layer**: Create REST endpoints for all service methods
2. **Database Implementation**: Complete repository implementations
3. **Integration**: Wire services into main application
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **UI**: Frontend components for rule management

### Architectural Choices

- Kept services loosely coupled for testability
- Used composition over inheritance for flexibility
- Implemented comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added extensive validation to prevent invalid states
- Created proper interfaces for dependency injection
