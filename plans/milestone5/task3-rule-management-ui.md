## Implementation Notes

### Decisions Made
- **Tabbed Interface Design**: Implemented unified tabbed interface for all rule types (Lists, Entries, Time Rules, Quota Rules)
- **Visual Feedback Priority**: Used Material-UI Chips and color coding for status indication and rule types
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Built foundational list management first, then added time/quota rule interfaces
- **Form Validation Approach**: Real-time validation with visual conflict detection for time rules

### Issues Encountered  
- **Material-UI v7 Grid Integration**: Resolved Grid component import issues with new v7 API
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Cleaned up unused imports and variables for zero-error compilation
- **Complex State Management**: Balanced form state complexity with user experience simplicity
