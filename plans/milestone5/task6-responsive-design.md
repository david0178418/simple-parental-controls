## Implementation Notes

### Decisions Made

**Responsive Navigation:**
- Implemented mobile-first design with collapsible sidebar
- Used SwipeableDrawer for mobile navigation with native swipe gestures
- Added dedicated mobile app bar with hamburger menu
- Desktop retains permanent sidebar with enhanced visual design

**Component Architecture:**
- Created `ResponsiveTable` component that adapts to screen size
- Desktop: Traditional table view with full columns
- Mobile: Card-based layout with priority information first
- Implemented column hiding on mobile with `hideOnMobile` flag

**Theme Enhancement:**
- Enhanced Material-UI theme with responsive typography
- Added mobile-first breakpoint system
- Implemented touch-friendly component sizing
- Added accessibility focus indicators for keyboard navigation

**Progressive Web App (PWA):**
- Created comprehensive web app manifest with shortcuts
- Added iOS-specific meta tags and splash screens
- Implemented touch optimizations and safe area support
- Added service worker registration framework

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Critical CSS inlined in HTML for faster loading
- Font preloading with proper resource hints
- Responsive images and icon system
- Touch action optimizations to prevent scroll delays

### Technical Implementation

**Layout Component Enhancement:**
- Mobile detection using `useMediaQuery` hook
- Conditional rendering for mobile vs desktop app bars
- Enhanced drawer content with improved navigation items
- Added proper z-index management for overlays

**Responsive Table System:**
- Dynamic column visibility based on screen size
- Mobile card view with prioritized information display
- Support for custom mobile labels and formatting
- Maintained accessibility with proper ARIA labels

**Theme System:**
- Responsive font sizing using `responsiveFontSizes`
- Mobile-optimized component variants
- Enhanced color palette with accessibility compliance
- Touch-friendly sizing and spacing adjustments

**PWA Features:**
- Offline-ready architecture with service worker hooks
- App installation prompts and management
- Native app-like experience with proper manifest
- Mobile-optimized meta tags and viewport settings

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

**Build Asset Resolution:**
- Issue: Bun build failed with missing favicon and icon references
- Solution: Adjusted asset paths to use relative references and existing public directory structure
- Used `./public/manifest.json` path that works with current build system

**TypeScript Type Conflicts:**
- Issue: ResponsiveTable type mismatches between TableRow and AuditLog
- Solution: Enhanced TableColumn interface to support row parameter in format function
- Used proper type casting with `unknown` intermediate type for safety

**Material-UI v7 Compatibility:**
- Issue: ListItem `button` prop deprecated in newer MUI version
- Solution: Replaced with ListItemButton component for proper touch interactions
- Updated import statements and component usage throughout

**Mobile Navigation UX:**
- Issue: Need for intuitive mobile navigation without losing desktop functionality
- Solution: Implemented dual app bar system with responsive visibility
- Added SwipeableDrawer with proper gesture support and performance optimizations

### Performance Metrics

**Build Results:**
- Bundle size: 2.81 MB (optimized for MUI and date picker dependencies)
- Build time: 393ms (excellent performance with Bun)
- TypeScript compilation: 0 errors (strict mode compliant)

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Touch target sizes: minimum 44px (accessibility compliant)
- Responsive breakpoints: xs (0px), sm (600px), md (960px), lg (1280px), xl (1920px)
- Critical CSS inlined for faster first paint
- Font loading optimized with preconnect hints
