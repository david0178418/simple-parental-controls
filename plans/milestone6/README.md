## Notes & Decisions Log

**Last Updated:** December 11, 2024  
**Next Review Date:** December 12, 2024  
**Current Blockers/Issues:** None currently identified

### Recent Progress
- âœ… **Task 1 Complete**: Password Hashing with bcrypt
  - Implemented secure bcrypt password hashing with configurable cost
  - Added comprehensive password strength validation
  - Created password history tracking to prevent reuse
  - Implemented rate limiting and account lockout protection
  - Added extensive test coverage with optimized test performance

- âœ… **Task 2 Complete**: Authentication Middleware
  - Created comprehensive authentication middleware with RequireAuth() and RequireAdmin() 
  - Implemented session validation via cookies and Authorization headers
  - Built AuthAPIServer with complete authentication endpoints
  - Added interface-based design to avoid circular imports
  - Integrated with existing middleware chain and error handling

### Next Steps
- Begin Task 3: Session Management
- Implement advanced session persistence and cleanup
- Add session management UI and administrative controls

### Architecture Decisions
- Extended existing SecurityConfig to maintain configuration consistency
- Used interface segregation pattern to avoid import cycles between packages
- Implemented adapter pattern at app level for clean service integration
- Created comprehensive middleware chains for different access levels
- Used in-memory storage for initial implementation (will integrate with database later)

### Recent Technical Achievements
- **Authentication Middleware**: Complete session-based authentication system
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin vs user privilege separation
- **API Security**: Protected endpoints with proper error handling
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie handling with HTTP security headers
- **Interface Design**: Clean separation of concerns avoiding circular dependencies
