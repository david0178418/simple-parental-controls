## Notes & Decisions Log

**Last Updated:** December 11, 2024  
**Next Review Date:** December 12, 2024  
**Current Blockers/Issues:** None currently identified

### Recent Progress
- âœ… **Task 1 Complete**: Password Hashing with bcrypt
  - Implemented secure bcrypt password hashing with configurable cost
  - Added comprehensive password strength validation
  - Created password history tracking to prevent reuse
  - Implemented rate limiting and account lockout protection
  - Added extensive test coverage with optimized test performance

### Next Steps
- Begin Task 2: Authentication Middleware
- Integrate authentication with existing HTTP server
- Create protected API endpoints

### Architecture Decisions
- Extended existing SecurityConfig to maintain configuration consistency
- Used in-memory storage for initial implementation (will integrate with database later)
- Implemented configurable security policies for different deployment scenarios
