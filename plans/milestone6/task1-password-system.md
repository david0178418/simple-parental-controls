# Task 1: Password Hashing with bcrypt

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Dependencies:** Milestone 4 Complete  

## Description
Implement secure password hashing system using bcrypt with proper salt generation and password validation.

---

## Subtasks

### 1.1 bcrypt Implementation ðŸ”´
- Implement bcrypt password hashing with configurable cost factor
- Create secure salt generation and management
- Add password hash validation and comparison
- Implement password strength requirements and validation

### 1.2 Password Management System ðŸ”´
- Create initial password setup and configuration
- Implement password change functionality
- Add password history tracking to prevent reuse
- Create password recovery mechanisms

### 1.3 Security Enhancements ðŸ”´
- Implement rate limiting for password attempts
- Add account lockout protection
- Create secure password storage and retrieval
- Implement password expiration policies

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Password authentication works reliably
- [ ] bcrypt hashing is properly implemented with appropriate cost
- [ ] Password validation includes strength requirements
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
