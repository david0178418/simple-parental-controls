# Task 1: Password Hashing with bcrypt

**Status:** 🟢 Complete  
**Dependencies:** Milestone 4 Complete  

## Description
Implement secure password hashing system using bcrypt with proper salt generation and password validation.

---

## Subtasks

### 1.1 bcrypt Implementation 🟢
- ✅ Implement bcrypt password hashing with configurable cost factor
- ✅ Create secure salt generation and management (handled by bcrypt)
- ✅ Add password hash validation and comparison
- ✅ Implement password strength requirements and validation

### 1.2 Password Management System 🟢
- ✅ Create initial password setup and configuration
- ✅ Implement password change functionality
- ✅ Add password history tracking to prevent reuse
- ⚠️ Create password recovery mechanisms (basic structure in place)

### 1.3 Security Enhancements 🟢
- ✅ Implement rate limiting for password attempts
- ✅ Add account lockout protection
- ✅ Create secure password storage and retrieval
- ✅ Implement password expiration policies

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Password authentication works reliably
- [x] bcrypt hashing is properly implemented with appropriate cost
- [x] Password validation includes strength requirements
- [x] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [x] Password changes are secure and audited

---

## Implementation Notes

### Decisions Made
- **bcrypt Cost Factor**: Default cost of 12 provides good security/performance balance
- **Password Requirements**: Configurable strength requirements with sensible defaults
- **In-Memory Storage**: Current implementation uses in-memory storage for rapid development
- **Session Management**: Integrated session creation and validation with authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic lockout after configurable failed attempts

### Issues Encountered  
- **Test Performance**: bcrypt operations were slow in tests - solved by using minimal cost (4) for testing
- **Configuration Integration**: Extended existing SecurityConfig to include all auth parameters
- **Password History**: Implemented in-memory tracking with configurable history size

### Resources Used
- Go bcrypt package: `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`
- Password strength best practices
- OWASP Authentication guidelines
