- **Policy-specific Stats**: Individual policy performance tracking

### Advanced Features
- **Preview Mode**: Estimate impact before execution with safety warnings
- **Priority System**: Policy execution ordering based on priority
- **Event Filtering**: Target specific event types and actions
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Cron-based execution scheduling
- **Concurrent Execution**: Configurable concurrent job limits

## üß™ Testing Status
