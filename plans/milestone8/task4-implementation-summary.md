- Service-specific performance tracking integration
- Configurable collection intervals and data retention

### 4.2 Metrics Analysis and Reporting âœ…
- Performance threshold monitoring with configurable alerts
- Performance trend analysis with statistical trend detection
- Performance reporting and comprehensive health scoring
- Real-time dashboard capabilities

### 4.3 Performance Optimization Integration âœ…
- Automatic performance tuning suggestions
- Performance-based configuration adjustments
- Performance regression detection with baseline comparison
- Automated optimization recommendations

## Files Created

1. **`internal/service/performance_monitor.go`** (700+ lines)
   - Centralized performance monitoring service
   - Comprehensive metrics collection from all components
   - Trend analysis and health scoring
   - Alert management and threshold monitoring

2. **`internal/server/api_performance.go`** (200+ lines)
   - Complete REST API for performance monitoring
   - Performance metrics, reports, and health endpoints
   - Threshold management and alert APIs

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/performance/metrics` - Current system performance metrics
- `GET /api/v1/performance/report` - Comprehensive performance analysis
- `GET /api/v1/performance/alerts` - Active performance alerts
- `GET /api/v1/performance/health` - System health score and status
- `POST /api/v1/performance/thresholds` - Add custom thresholds
- `DELETE /api/v1/performance/thresholds/{name}` - Remove thresholds

## Key Features Achieved

- âœ… Centralized metrics collection from all system services
- âœ… Real-time performance monitoring and alerting
- âœ… Statistical trend analysis and regression detection  
- âœ… Comprehensive health scoring (0-100 scale)
