## Current Session Progress

### ✅ Task 1 Windows Compatibility - Major Progress
**Status Changed:** 🔴 Not Started → 🟡 In Progress

#### Completed Components:
1. **Cross-Platform Build System** ✅
   - Fixed Windows build compatibility (syscall.Statfs issue)
   - Created platform-specific disk space monitoring
   - Validated cross-platform builds working

2. **Windows Network Filtering Framework** ✅
   - Implemented Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) integration
   - Created `internal/enforcement/windows_filter.go`
   - Added WFP API bindings and basic filter management

3. **Platform-Specific Service Components** ✅
   - Windows disk space monitoring using GetDiskFreeSpaceExW
   - Unix disk space monitoring using syscall.Statfs
   - Maintained existing Windows process monitoring

#### Build Validation ✅
```bash
make build-linux    # ✅ Working
make build-windows  # ✅ Working  
make build-cross    # ✅ Working
```

#### Next Steps for Task 1:
- Windows service integration and UAC handling
- Enhanced WFP implementation with real filtering
- Windows-specific testing and validation

## Milestone Completion Checklist

### Platform Support
- [x] Windows build system works correctly
- [⏳] Application runs reliably on Windows 10+ *(Framework complete, needs testing)*
- [ ] Application runs on Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora
- [⏳] All features work consistently across platforms *(Windows framework complete)*
- [ ] Performance requirements met on all platforms

### Build System
- [x] Cross-platform builds work reliably
- [⏳] Platform-specific features are properly handled *(Windows framework complete)*
- [x] Dependencies are managed correctly per platform
- [x] Build artifacts are properly generated

## Notes & Decisions Log

### Current Session Achievements
- **Windows Compatibility Foundation**: Successfully resolved all Windows build issues and created comprehensive Windows support framework
- **Cross-Platform Architecture**: Established clean separation between platform-specific implementations using build constraints
- **API Integration**: Implemented Windows-specific APIs (GetDiskFreeSpaceExW, WFP) with proper error handling

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Build Strategy**: Used `//go:build windows` and `//go:build !windows` for clean platform separation
- **Windows APIs**: Selected Windows Filtering Platform for network filtering over alternatives
- **Compatibility Approach**: Maintained existing Windows process monitoring from Milestone 2, built upon proven foundation

### Next Priorities
1. Complete Windows service integration and privilege management
2. Enhance WFP implementation with full filtering capabilities  
3. Begin Task 2: Linux distribution compatibility testing
4. Comprehensive cross-platform testing suite

**Last Updated:** Current Session  
**Next Review Date:** After Task 1 completion  
**Current Blockers/Issues:** None - good progress on Windows compatibility framework
